/*
Consider NewYork city which has grid like structure of houses. 
You are provided the city map in the form of a matrix. Each cell 
represents a building. From each building you can go to adjacent four 
buildings in four directions : east, west, north, south. Spiderman 
wants to rescue a victim which is on some building. You will be provided 
with the location of victim and spiderman is situated at (1,1) building. 
But, there is a condition that spiderman can not jump between buildings 
if the difference in their heights is greater than some particular 
value. Find a way for spiderman to reach the victim by crossing the 
minimum number of buildings.

Input
Input contains multiple test cases. First Line is a integer T, 
representing the number of test cases to follow.

First line of each test case has 4 numbers â€“ M, N, X, Y, D. Here MxN is 
the dimension of the city grid. (X,Y) is location of victim.

This is followed by M lines. Each line consist of N space separated 
positive integers corresponding to building heights. D is the maximum 
difference between heights of buildings that spiderman can cross.
Output
One line for each test case containing a single integer, denoting the 
minimum number of buildings spiderman needs to cross. Return -1 if its 
not not possible.
